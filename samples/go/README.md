## Prerequisites

* Docker

## Building and Running

1. Run `docker run -it trustwallet/wallet-core`
The librabry is already built in this image  (Build instructions [here](building.md))  Note: may not be the most recent version.

2. Install go: `apt-get update && apt-get install golang` 
(or download from here [go1.13.3](https://dl.google.com/go/go1.13.3.linux-amd64.tar.gz), configure `GOROOT` and append `GOROOT/bin` to `PATH`).
3. Go to the **samples/go** folder within wallet core repo:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/trustwallet/wallet-core.git
cd wallet-core/samples/go
```

4. Compile it by `go build -o main`.  Relavant source file is `main.go`.

5. Run `./main` and you will see the output below: 

```shell
==> calling wallet core from go
<== mnemonic is valid:  true
```
6. You might want to copy and run `main` outside of the docker container, make sure you have `libc++1` and `libc++abi1` installed in your host Ubuntu.
